        <TextBlock HorizontalAlignment="Left" TextWrapping="Wrap" Text="In order to use this tool, you must have root access on the device you are planning on altering the save for, and have a way to access the save data with a root file manager on said device. The file that you need for this to work is &quot;u00_cardlib.dat&quot;, and it will only work with that file. You can find this file on your device by going to the root directory of the device (not the internal storage), then navigating to /data/data/com.konami.ygodgtest/files/u00_cardlib.dat. Once you have located this file, copy it to your computer (I personally back up the save first, and you should, too. I also copy it to the device internal storage first, then copy that to the computer). Then, open the file with the Open File button, and press &quot;Quick give all&quot; in order to give yourself every card with the push of a single button. Finally, click Export, and select the same file that you copied to your computer in order to save it. Now, just copy that file back onto your phone, replace the file in the directory you originally got it from with the new file you just exported to, and voilà! You now have every card in the game that has a known card number on the yugioh wikia (https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Yu-Gi-Oh!_Duel_Generation_cards)."
